x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

This => "3" because x is described as 0 and through the program, it is modified by adding +1 three times.  This changes the value of x to 3.

y = 0
3.times do
  y+= 1
  x = y
end
puts x

This returns => "exercise5.rb:6:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object (NameError)" because y is defined outside of the do/end block but x is not.  If you move the definition of x to outside of the block, you are able to run the program.
