1. '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")

Does string4 = integer4? If so, print true, if not print false
Should print false because a string != an integer
    "FALSE
     => nil"


2. x = 2
   if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
     puts "Did you get it right?"
   else
     puts "Did you?"
   end

Assigning a value.  if 3 == 3, puts did you get it right.  else puts did you?
Should print "Did you get it right?"
    "Did you get it right?
     => nil"


3. y = 9
   x = 10
   if (x + 1) <= (y)
     puts "Alright."
   elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
     puts "Alright now!"
   elsif (y + 1) == x
     puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
   else
     puts "Alrighty!"
   end

Assigning values.  If 11 <= 9 puts alright.  (no)  If 11 >=9 puts alright now.  (yes)  If 10 == 10 puts ALRIGHT NOW.  (yes) Else puts alrighty.
Should print "Alright now!" since it is the first true arguement.
    "Alright now!
    => nil"
